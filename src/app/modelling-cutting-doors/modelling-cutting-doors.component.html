      <p class="ui red message">Small spoiler: In the end of the video we discover a small hole in the mesh which was caused by joining. As already said in the video
        this will be fixed in a later video. You can also try to fix it right away if you like a little challenge. At the time I recorded this
        video I did not recognize that the mesh was broken.
